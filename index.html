<h1>STRANGE MEET</h1>
<h2>A meeting of strange results.</h2>
<p>In the last few years the number of awesome and amazing, can't be missed conferences has seemed to sky rocket. Strange Meet is a gathering where we are inviting a bunch of our friends to present about whatever topic they want, without the restrictions and pressures of a themed event. We're also hoping that Strange Meet will be an opportunity for all our friends to get a chance to share some of their knowledge in front of an audience.</p>
<p>The day will consist of a series of talks, workshops, exhibitions and lots of meeting some strange new people.</p>

<h2>Why should I come?</h2>
<p>It might be a total waste of time but we'll be providing three free meals either way.</p>

<h2>When and where is this waste of time happening?</h2>
<p>All day starting at 10 AM on June 11th in the Dumbo area of Brooklyn, NY. Exact location and schedule details will follow in an email closer to the date.</p>

<h2>Who is will be there?</h2>
<p>Our goal for this mini conference is to put a lot of our friends who don't know each other in the same space.</p>
<p>If you are reading this page you are probably already friends with (or a friend-of-a-friend of) one of the organizers.</p>

<h2>What will be discussed?</h2>
<p>We don't know yet. We're inviting a lot of cool and interesting people and asking them to talk about whatever they want.</p>
